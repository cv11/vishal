<li> Information Technology has a great influence in the way we do business. The use of right
technology has the potential to revolutionize business process and organisations and
make them more efficient. Mobile commerce and cloud computing has the capability to
modernize the business. </li>

<li> Opportunities in e-business are growing as the world becomes more interconnected on
the web. </li>

<li> With the help of Cloud computing we can transforms the economics hardware and
software at the same time. It allows consumers and business to use applications without
installing and access their personal files at any computer with internet access.</li>

<li> Example: <ol> <li>Accessing our mails (No need of any software or a server to use them)</li>
<li>Google Drive</li>
</ol>


<li> We just need an internet connection and we can start sending emails. The server and
email management software is all on the cloud (internet) and is totally managed by the
cloud service provider.</li>
