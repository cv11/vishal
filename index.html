<p> <a href=" http://vishal11.weebly.com/uploads/1/7/6/7/17678417/traffic_light_controller.pdf"target=_blank><strong> 1) Traffic Light Controller.(Aug, 2014-Oct, 2014) </strong></a>
  </br  />Timer based Traffic light control was simulated using VERILOG programming on Xilinx.</p>

<p><a href=" http://vishal11.weebly.com/uploads/1/7/6/7/17678417/sensor_alarm_using_thyristor.pdf"target=_blank><strong>2) Sensor alarm using thyristor. (Mar, 2014 - Apr, 2014) </strong></a> 
</br  />It does the job of sensing and indication using an alarm. This sensor alarm is designed to detect intrusion, unauthorized entry into a building or area. The circuit uses diodes, capacitors, resistors for biasing the thyristor and sounding the alarm.</p>

<p><a href=" http://vishal11.weebly.com/uploads/1/7/6/7/17678417/digital_voltmeter_using_micro-controller_ic_8051..pdf"target=_blank><strong>3) Digital Voltmeter using Micro-controller IC 8051. (Aug, 2013 - Oct, 2013) </strong></a> 
<br  /> It is used to get digital voltage reading from an analog source and display the voltage on a LCD display. A standard analog-to- digital converter ADC0804 was used.</p>

<p> <a href=" http://vishal11.weebly.com/uploads/1/7/6/7/17678417/light_activated_siren.pdf"target=_blank><strong>4) Light Activated Siren. (Jan, 2013 - Apr, 2013) </strong></a>    
<br  /> It does the job of sensing the light and indicating an alarm to the user. The principle is based on use of LDR component with a combination of transistors and Resistors for biasing. </p>

<p> <a href=" http://vishal11.weebly.com/uploads/1/7/6/7/17678417/dark_sensor.pdf"target=_blank><strong>5) Dark Sensor using two transistors. ( Aug, 2012 - Sept, 2012) </strong></a>    
<br  /> The desired circuit was successfully tested on breadboard and then implemented on Dotted PCB.</p>
